# Leetcode-1814-Number-Count-Mod

A medium problem
It's not really hard, but my answer exceeds the limit. 
The problem is, my solution uses the linear time complexity, and I changed the way I do the mod the following way:
I used to mod the answer only at the very end, but that seems to be a problem
Therefore, I added a mod when the count is changed, which reduces the runtime so that the solution is accepted.
Again, hints helped a lot. The first step is actually about doing math.
